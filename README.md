# Resident Services

## About

The model was built from the ground up using [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), exported as a `.stl` file, imported into [PrusaSlicer](https://www.prusa3d.com/page/prusaslicer_424/), sliced and the result is saved as a `.gcode` file. This print was designed around it being printed on a Prusa Mini+.

> _**NOTE:**_ The `.gcode` files have been removed from tracking. It's not safe to print using someone else's gcode files. Could contain altered and malicious changes that could damage your 3D printer. Please use the STL files in your slicer of choice and generate the gcode on your own. Please let me know if you have any questions and thank you! Enjoy these prints!

> _**IMPORTANT:**_ It is never recommended to print from someone elses gcode file. That is why I included the `.stl` files in this repo. I recommend you use the stl files in your slicer of choice to re-create the `.gcode` file.
